Abstract : With the advancement in autonomous vehicles detection of traffic signals is necessary. Different deep-learning
models have been implemented to achieve this. Training the
model on the go is not a feasible solution and for real-time
applications, inference time is expected to be as low as possible.
Running Deep Learning models on edge devices is a challenge
as it requires memory and computational resources. The edge
device used for this purpose is Raspberry pi. The deep learning
model used to detect traffic signals is R-CNN as it helps set a
bounding box to detect the signals. With this model implemented
on raspberry pi, we were able to train and achieve the detection
of traffic signals.
